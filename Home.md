LightGBM, Light Gradient Boosting Machine
=========================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/LightGBM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/LightGBM)

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:

- Faster training speed and higher efficiency
- Lower memory usage
- Better accuracy
- Parallel learning supported
- Capable of handling large-scale data

For more details, please refer to [Features](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Features).

[Experiments](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Experiments#comparison-experiment) on public datasets show that LightGBM can outperform other existing boosting framework on both efficiency and accuracy, with significant lower memory consumption. What's more, the [experiments](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Experiments#parallel-experiment) show that LightGBM can achieve a linear speed-up by using multiple machines for training in specific settings.
